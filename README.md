# GTU CSE108 - Computer Programming Lab

This repository contains solutions to the CSE108 Computer Programming Lab exercises, studied during the 1st year (Spring semester) of Computer Engineering at Gebze Technical University.

The course was structured as weekly lab exams throughout 14 weeks:
- Each week, students were given a lab sheet containing programming questions.
- We had 2 hours to solve the problems in the lab environment.

This repository includes both the original lab sheets (PDFs) and the solutions I prepared.

üëâ I hope this repository will be helpful for you!
