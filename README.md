# GTU CSE108 - Computer Programming Lab

This repository contains solutions to the CSE108 Computer Programming Lab exercises, studied during the 1st year (Spring semester) of Computer Engineering at Gebze Technical University (GTU).

### The course was structured as weekly lab exams throughout 14 weeks:
- Each week, students were given a lab sheet containing programming questions. We had 2 hours to solve the problems in the lab environment.
- The labs were conducted on Ubuntu and external IDEs such as VS Code were not allowed. We had to use the terminal and basic text editors.

### Each folder includes:
- The original lab sheets (PDFs)
- The C code solutions that I wrote
